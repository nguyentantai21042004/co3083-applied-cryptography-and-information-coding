# CO3083 - Applied Cryptography and Information Coding
## Introduction

This is a personal repository containing all materials, code, and writeups for the course **CO3083 - Applied Cryptography and Information Coding**.

## Repository Structure

### 1. Overleaf Sync (`overleaf-sync/`)
Contains all LaTeX files for syncing with Overleaf:
- `current-project/` - Current project (main.tex, contents, images, outro)
- `templates/` - LaTeX templates for different document types
  - `assignments/` - Templates for assignments
  - `reports/` - Templates for reports  
  - `presentations/` - Templates for presentation slides
  - `thesis/` - Templates for thesis/project reports
- `common/` - Common styles, packages, and macros

### 2. CryptoHack Writeups (`cryptohack-writeups/`)
Contains detailed solutions for challenges on CryptoHack.org:
- `introduction/` - Basic challenges
- `general/` - General techniques
- `mathematics/` - Cryptographic mathematics
- `symmetric-ciphers/` - Symmetric encryption
- `rsa/` - RSA algorithm
- `elliptic-curves/` - Elliptic curves
- `misc/` - Other challenges
- `common/` - Utilities and templates

### 3. Test Source Code (`test-code/`)
Contains implementations and test code:
- `cryptography/` - Implementation of cryptographic algorithms
- `algorithms/` - Related algorithms and data structures
- `implementations/` - Practice code
- `experiments/` - Experiments and benchmarks
- `common/` - Common libraries, configs, and data

### 4. References (`references/`)
Contains reference materials and learning resources:
- `books/` - Textbooks, references (PDF/EPUB)
- `papers/` - Scientific papers, research papers
- `slides/` - Lecture slides, presentations
- `notes/` - Personal notes, summaries

### 5. Other Content
- `keyword-contents/` - Reports from old project (can be deleted later)

## How to Use

1. **Overleaf Sync**: Copy the entire `overleaf-sync/` folder to your Overleaf project
2. **CryptoHack**: Add new writeups to the corresponding directory in `cryptohack-writeups/`
3. **Test Code**: Save test code and implementations in `test-code/`
4. **References**: Save books, papers, slides in `references/` by topic

## Conventions

- Each CryptoHack writeup should have format: `challenge-name.md` with accompanying code
- LaTeX templates should have clear documentation on how to use
- Test code should have comments and README in each directory
